Don't hold back your smile.

When you see, hear, or think of something that makes you feel happy, allow yourself to smile it out.

Your smilling face will then makes you feel even happier, and might remind people around you of their own happiness aswell.

Too much of our happiness are kept down because it's not "appropriate" to smile or giggle in certain spots. I say when we notice that we're feeling happy, just embrace it and have that moment for ourselves, without fearing the judgements of others. No one will even notice your smiles or giggles in the first place, and even when they do, those smiles and giggles of yours will make other people happier, not worse.

Letting your happiness out freely is a win-win in my book.
